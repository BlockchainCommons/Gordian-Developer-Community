## Mission

**Gordian Developer Community** is a community of cryptocurrency & identity wallet developers, sharing best practices for paritioned interoperability among multiple vendors on multiple platforms. These best practices include support for hot, cold and multisig cryptographic wallets, research & proposals for data formats and protocols, usage of gaps such as airgaps and torgaps, security and UX for multisig work flows, and other key management and signing issues and topics, particularly those that support the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness.

## Meetings

Much of our collaborative work is conducted through Meetings. Please sign up for our [Gordian Developer lists](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe.html) to be informed of when they occur and please see our [meetings page](/meetings/README.md) for info from meetings to date.

## URs

One of our most successful interoperable specifications to date has been `ur:`. Following is a table of usage. 

_Please submit PRs if you are aware of different usages or to make corrections._

More info on PRs can be found in our [research papers](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) and in our [UR docs](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons#urs).

## Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian Developer Community**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about interoperable wallet specifications, please use the Discussions area of the [Gordian Developer Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions). This is where you talk about Gordian specifications such as [Gordian Envelope](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/tree/master/Envelope#articles), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), and [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur) as well as the larger [Gordian Architecture](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md), its [Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, and its macro-architectural ideas such as functional partition (including airgapping, the original name of this community).

We also have [a Signal group and a low-volume announcement mailing list](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe.html#gordian-developers).

We want to keep all of our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
