## Mission

**Gordian Developer Community** is a community of cryptocurrency & identity wallet developers, sharing best practices for paritioned interoperability among multiple vendors on multiple platforms. These best practices include support for hot, cold and multisig cryptographic wallets, research & proposals for data formats and protocols, usage of gaps such as airgaps and torgaps, security and UX for multisig work flows, and other key management and signing issues and topics, particularly those that support the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness.

## Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian Developer Community**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Gordian Developer repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.
