# Blockchain Commons BIP-85/Seed Resilience Meeting

Blockchain Commons' August Gordian Developer Meeting (Wednesday, August 7th, 10am PDT) will focus on seed resilience, with BIP-85 champion Aneesh Karve offering the main presentation of our meeting, on BIP-85.

BIP-85 is a method for deterministically generating children seeds from a master seed using a simple index. It allows a single master seed to generate the seeds used in multiple wallets. It's especially useful for hot wallets, as a master seed held in cold storage can create children seeds for them. Aneesh will reveal the specifics, talking about the current status of BIP-85, how it can be used by developers, and why it's often more useful than deriving hierarchical deterministic keys.

* WHAT? BIP-85 / Seed Resilience Gordian Developer Meeting 
* WHEN? Wednesday August 7th, 10am PDT (1pm EDT, 7pm CEST) 
* WHERE? https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83804165219?pwd=mrV3y0uT9gNbz5SOh01baGilJL90Ar.1

Beyond Aneesh's feature presentation on BIP-85, August's meeting will be all about seeds and ensuring their resilience. What features should we be including in our seed storage as best practices? BIP-85, descriptors, other metadata, or something else? Which features are worth incorporating into Blockchain Commons' own reference apps, our recently released seedtool-cli for Rust and Seedtool for iOS? Bring your own seed-related topic and we'll be happy to discuss that too!
