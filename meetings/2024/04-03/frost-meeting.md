Our presenter will be Jesse Posner, who is Senior Blockchain Engineer at Block and working on the [secp/ZKP FROST](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/138).

We'll take a look at what threshold signatures are, how they look just like single sigs using Schnorr, how Verifiable Secret Sharing can change the face of seed backsup, and how Distributed Key Generation can change everything.
