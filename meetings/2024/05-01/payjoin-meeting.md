# PayJoin/Gordian Developer Meeting

May's Gordian Developer Meeting will include a feature presentation on PayJoin v2 by Dan Gould, the author of the updated proposal.

The original PayJoin was a 2019 proposal that better preserved privacy in Bitcoin transactions and gave a receiver the opportunity to consolidate their own UTXOs without new fees (and without mixing!). The new version simplifies PayJoin's usage by not requiring the receiver to have a public server to help transmit the negotiations. Come learn more about why Payjoin is a great advancement on Bitcoin privacy and how Payjoin v2 improves the protocol!
