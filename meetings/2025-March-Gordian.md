Our main topics will be:

* POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY. We've introduced it to the Gordian stack! A bit on what it is and how to use it.
* FOUNDATION DEVICES. Our long-time friends & supporters at Foundation Devices have announced a new wallet & are doing work with some Gordian specs. They'll talk about where they're at.
* ZCASH INTERCHANGE. We've been working on a grant to help unify Zcash Wallet Interchange. How's that going and why's it important for the larger ecosystem?
