# Blockchain Commons Identifier Meeting

Blockchain Common's November Gordian meeting is going to focus on a unique topic that's been a long-time interest: decentralized identifiers. We've recently made breakthroughs on this work and how identifiers can be used with Gordian Envelope, FROST, MuSig, and other up-and-coming technologies.

* WHAT? Gordian Developers Identifier Meeting
* WHEN? Wednesday, November 6th 2024
* WHAT TIME? 10am PST (1pm EST, 7pm CET)
* WHERE? https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81330446533?pwd=enlabktDMVpIUE9PcmU5SkVlU3liQT09

We're planning to discuss three topics:

* CRYPTOGRAPHIC CLIQUES & EDGE IDENTIFIERS. We've recently written a pair of articles (["Edge Identifiers & Cliques"](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-cliques-1/) and ["Open & Fuzzy Cliques"](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-cliques-2/)) on a new model for identity that focuses on relationships rather than individuals. TL;DR? We'll present on it.
* GSTP & MUSIG. Edge Identifiers and Cliques depend on the use of Schnorr-based signatures, which are aggregatable: they produce multisigs that are the same size as single signatures. We've been working on how to use Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol (GSTP) to enable a MuSig signature. We'll show you our sequence diagrams. It's a great real-world use case for GSTP that demonstrates how to use GSTP when you're working with more than two parties.
* XIDs & CONTROLLER DOCS. Finally, we've been doing some napkin-sketch work on how to use Envelopes to create DID-inspired identifiers & controller docs. Time allowing, we'll cover this too.

If you're interested in identity on the internet, we expect we'll see you at the meeting. But, we definitely encourage wallet developers to attend too: not only is identity a crucial element in managing digital-asset transactions online, but we also expect that our GSTP/MuSig use case should offer a great model for using GSTP in all sorts of circumstances (whether it's for signing PSBTs, storing seed shares, or something else).
