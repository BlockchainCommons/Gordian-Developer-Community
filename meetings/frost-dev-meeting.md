# FROST Developer Meeting

In December we'll be offering a special set of presentations for wallet developers who are looking to implement FROST in 2025 (and you should be! it's a great new, lightweight multisig system).

* WHAT? FROST Developer Meeting
* WHEN? Wednesday, December 4th 2024
* WHAT TIME? 10am PST (1pm EST, 7pm CET)
* WHERE? https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81330446533?pwd=enlabktDMVpIUE9PcmU5SkVlU3liQT09

We've got three presentations planned so far and hope to add at least one more:

* STACK WALLET. Stack is the first production wallet to successfully integrate FROST, including features such as changing and reconstructing thresholds. They'll discuss how they did so.
* ZCASH FROST UniFFI SDK. If you want to implement FROST, another option is the UniFFI SDK, which converts the Zcash Rust FROST system into GoLang, Kotlin, and Swift.
* FROST FEDERATIONS. There are lots of uses for FROST! Our final presentation will talk about its use to manage a federation with a mining pool as a case study.

If you're a wallet developer, we hope to see you there. This is the future of wallets in 2025!

And, if you've already implemented FROST in a wallet or elsewhere, or if you have a library that developers can use, let us know, we'd love to have a short (5-10 minute) presentation from you.
